    "## LAK 2018 Workshop: Turning the TAP on Writing Analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Organisers: Antonette Shibani, Sophie Abel, Andrew Gibson & Simon Knight\n",
    "\n",
    "### Workshop Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop aims to build writing analytics capacity through developing writing analytics literacy both at this event and beyond. Workshop activities will have two foci: the technical, and the social, both targeted at provision of feedback that supports student writing. The workshop will engage participants with the Text Analytics Pipeline (TAP), and the mapping of textual features output by TAP to rules that can be used to provide feedback to students.\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will take a participatory approach, blending workshop, tutorial, and hackathon to consider the potential of text analytics tools for supporting writing, and how through use of openly available tools and a data carpentry approach, novices to text analytics – including educators, learning technologists, and others – can be inducted into its potential. Our focus today will be on a writing task context where text analytics can help provide automated feedback on students' writing. The entire session will be hands-on, interacting with a text analytics system via this Jupyter notebook. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "The workshop will run using this Jupyter notebook. The [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. It can support many languages and the current notebook runs in Python. You will all work with your own notebooks (using the login IDs provided by us), so you can hack and play around with code and data. The notebook contain different segments for code, and text. The current segment is a Markdown in which we are providing a narrative text. We will have code segments where we will execute Python code to do some text analysis using TAP.  \n",

    "### The Writing Analytics Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Using some basic writing analytics, *this notebook demonstrates the process through which pedagogy and analytics come together* in order to provide formative feedback to students on their writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key elements of the process are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A clearly defined learning task\n",
    "- An understanding of the students response to the task (the writing)\n",
    "- One or more hypotheses on how aspects of the learning task may be related to computationally identifiable features in the student writing\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout the process, the aim is to balance what is possible with the technology (i.e. Natural Language Processing - NLP) with what is valuable in terms of student learning. This is illustrated in the following diagram:\n",

    "**Aims:** This assessment aims to develop your skills in building an argument and providing evidence to support your claims.\n",

    "**Task:** You will write an argumentative essay on the ethical issues arising from our treatment of animals. You will consider what rights animals should be granted and what ethical implications arise between differentiating people from animals. Your discussion should include philosophical thinking on animal ethics.\n",

    "In this assignment, you will: \n",
    "*\tIdentify an ethical issue \n",
    "*\tLocate 4 recent articles relevant to the issue of a sufficiently high quality to support an academic discussion \n",
    "* Link your discussion to 2 philosophers from this list: Tom Regan, Immanuel Kant, René Descartes, Thomas Aquinas, Aristotle, Peter Carruthers, Joel Feinberg, Raymond Frey, Jeremy Bentham, Peter Singer\n",

       "<p>Today most of us accept science. Science of today, especially Darwins Evolutionary Theory teaches us that the human race has developed from animals and that humanbeings basically are animals among other animals. <span class=\"long\">Eventhough we do agree with this aspect of science we tend to consider man as the almighty, powerful, crown of creation with a natural right to treat animals as we please and use them for our own purposes as food, tools and experiment instruments, and I belive this is wrong and in this essay I will explain why we morally have no right to exploit animals.</span> I am also going to show how meaningless many of the experiments made on animals are. <p>To begin with I would like to say that the line we draw today in order to distinguish ourselves from animals is strictly arbitrary, illogical and selfish and there isn't a quality and that includes all humanity that empowers us a narural position as top of the food chain and superiour to animals. Most humanbeings have unique capacities though, such as language and higher mental abilities than animals but it's important to emphasize that these abilities don't include all humanity, for example they don't include people with an intellectual disability, psychiatric disability or newborns (Carruthers, 1992). <p>The concept 'animals' is very wide and include a variety of different creatures from chimpanzees to oysters. We are often very conscious about making a distinction between humans and chimpanzees but scientifically it's proved that humans are more psycologically related to chimpanzees than chimpanzees are to oysters. Thus, personally I think it would be more logical to draw the line between creatures that have consciousness and those who haven't. The animals with consciousness have feelings and goals for their existence, they have emotions and can feel pain and joy and know if a thing goes good or bad. <span class=\"long\">All these animals should have the same right as humans to exist for their own sake as individuals and not being valued just for how useful they are to humans, for example, just as we wouldn't do experiments on people with intelectual disabilities we shouldnt do it to animals since intelectual abilities seem to be the things we base the world hierarcy upon.</span></p>"

       "<p>Today most of us accept science. Science of today, especially Darwins Evolutionary Theory teaches us that the human race has developed from animals and that humanbeings basically are animals among other animals. <span class=\"moveformat\"><button class=\"tagbtn\">contrast</button>Eventhough we do agree with this aspect of science we tend to consider man as the almighty, powerful, crown of creation with a natural right to treat animals as we please and use them for our own purposes as food, tools and experiment instruments, and I belive this is wrong and in this essay I will explain why we morally have no right to exploit animals.</span> <span class=\"moveformatsumm\"><button class=\"tagbtn\">contribution</button>I am also going to show how meaningless many of the experiments made on animals are.</span> <p>To begin with I would like to say that the line we draw today in order to distinguish ourselves from animals is strictly arbitrary, illogical and selfish and there isn't a quality and that includes all humanity that empowers us a narural position as top of the food chain and superiour to animals. Most humanbeings have unique capacities though, such as language and higher mental abilities than animals but it's important to emphasize that these abilities don't include all humanity, for example they don't include people with an intellectual disability, psychiatric disability or newborns (Carruthers, 1992). <p>The concept 'animals' is very wide and include a variety of different creatures from chimpanzees to oysters. We are often very conscious about making a distinction between humans and chimpanzees but scientifically it's proved that humans are more psycologically related to chimpanzees than chimpanzees are to oysters. Thus, personally I think it would be more logical to draw the line between creatures that have consciousness and those who haven't. The animals with consciousness have feelings and goals for their existence, they have emotions and can feel pain and joy and know if a thing goes good or bad. All these animals should have the same right as humans to exist for their own sake as individuals and not being valued just for how useful they are to humans, for example, just as we wouldn't do experiments on people with intelectual disabilities we shouldnt do it to animals since intelectual abilities seem to be the things we base the world hierarcy upon.</p>"
